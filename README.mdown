# Line Detection

Demonstration of a line detection algorithm.

## Algorithm

Given a set of points P
For all sub sets P' where |P'| is 2
For both points p in P'

1. Consider the set of points Q: P - P'
2. Consider the result list R: [p1, p2]
3. Choose a point q from Q that is 'in line' with the line chain R
4. Remove q from Q
5. Add q to R
